This repo was created to track my learning progress as I code.
I have removed many files as they are irrelevant to my practice.
It's not a lot, but more is to come (watch this space).
As of today 30th August, the main .py files I have practiced with are broken01.py, broken02.py, practice.py, rockpapergame.py and app.py.
You can check any of the above files to view my code.
I am reachable at abambatega@gmail.com
