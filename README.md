This Repo is created for tracking my learning progress as I code.
I have removed a bunch of files as they are not relevant to my practice.
Its not a lot, but there is more to come (watch tis space).
As of today 30th August, the main ,py files I have practiced with are broken01.py, broken02.py, practice.py, rockpapergame.py and app.py.
You can check any of the above files to view my code.
I am reachable on abambatega@gmail.com
